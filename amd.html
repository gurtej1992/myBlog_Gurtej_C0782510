    <h2>Amd Computers</h2>
    <p>Recently we took a look at how well the Ryzen 5 3600 performed in games when <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2113-ryzen-3600-rtx-3080-combo/">paired with the GeForce RTX 3080</a> and we did this upon readers and viewers' request. That ended up being a very popular test and since the release of the Radeon RX 6800 series we’ve seen just as many requests for a repeat but this time using the Radeon GPU.</p>

    <p>Since our first test, there have also been new relevant game releases and we suspect once you can actually buy it, the RX 6800 will be a popular graphics card choice. With so many of you using the still amazing Ryzen 5 3600, it makes sense to see how it performs with the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2146-amd-radeon-6800/">new RDNA2 GPU</a> -- though right now we feel the Intel <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2032-intel-core-i5-10400/">Core i5-10400F</a> is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-10400F-Desktop-Processor-Graphics/dp/B086MHSTWN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Core+i5-10400F&amp;qid=1609726815&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=httpwwwtechsp-20" class="norewrite">better value</a> buy, so perhaps a comparison with that part in the coming weeks might be a good idea.</p>

    <p>For this article we’re going to look at performance in 21 games at 1080p, 1440p and 4K with the R5 3600 in a stock configuration using 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 memory. We’ve not bothered to overclock the Ryzen processor this time and have instead opted to add more games.</p>

    <p>Also please note the Ryzen 9 3950X and Core i9-10900K have been included purely as reference points and have not been overclocked either. This isn’t a CPU vs. CPU content piece, rather we’re just seeing how close the Ryzen 5 3600 can get to delivering $500+ CPU performance in games.</p>
